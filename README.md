# Bitcoin Price Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes Bitcoin prices across different exchanges using data fetched from Quandl. It leverages libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `plotly`, and `quandl` to retrieve, process, and visualize Bitcoin price data. The project demonstrates caching fetched data to improve efficiency and includes visualizations of Bitcoin price trends.

## Features
- **Data Fetching**: Retrieve Bitcoin price data from multiple exchanges using the Quandl API.
- **Caching Mechanism**: Cache fetched data to avoid redundant API calls and improve performance.
- **Data Merging**: Combine data from different exchanges into a single DataFrame for comparative analysis.
- **Visualization**: Use Plotly to create interactive plots of Bitcoin prices.
- **Average Price Calculation**: Compute and plot the average Bitcoin price across exchanges.
